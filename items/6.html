            <p>Mini Fun Obby is a Roblox obby/parkour game written from scratch, no third-party tools were used while making this game.</p>
            <p>The game has a small set of options to choose from, including being able to teleport to past stages in the game.</p>
            <p>The reason I made this game is to challenge myself to make a game from scratch with Roblox Studio.</p>
