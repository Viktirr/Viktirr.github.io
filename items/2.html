            <p>This script enables you to create multiple replay buffers in OBS.</p>
            <p>In its inception, this tool was used to compress videos after a recording session, however, over time, I've added a few additional features to this script, including the Multiple Replay Buffers you may know today.</p>
            <p class="lower-bottom-margin">The latest version of the script includes the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Saving anywhere between 5 seconds to 20 minutes (or more if your computer can handle it) of your gameplay!</li>
                <li>Automatically organise your videos in folders depending on the game you're playing (similar to Shadowplay).</li>
                <li>Compress your videos with x264 or x265.</li>
                <li>Get notified whenever you save a video.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The script is written in AutoHotkey, it also requires FFmpeg and OBS to work properly.</p>
            <p>The script also offers a couple of customisation options, including the amount of replay buffers you may want to change, the duration of each replay buffer, what kind of compression to use (if any) and enabling/disabling notifications.</p>
            <p>You may find additional details on the GitHub page.</p>
